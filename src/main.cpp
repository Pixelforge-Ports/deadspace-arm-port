/*
 * Dead Space loader — entry point.
 *
 * This file used to be a NativeActivity driver: open an APK, map the
 * game's .so out of it, build an ANativeActivity and hand it to
 * ANativeActivity_onCreate, then watch the engine run its own frame loop.
 *
 * None of that applies here, and the run log said so in one line:
 *
 *     FATAL: cannot open APK '/game': Operation not supported
 *
 * because the harness passes a *directory*. That error is only the surface of
 * it. Dead Space is not a NativeActivity game at all:
 *
 *   - it has no DT_NEEDED on libandroid.so and exports no
 *     ANativeActivity_onCreate; its DT_NEEDED list is exactly
 *     libc / libstdc++ / libm / liblog / libGLESv1_CM
 *   - it exports JNI_OnLoad plus 68 Java_* entry points and expects a Java
 *     layer to call them, frame by frame. That layer is this file.
 *   - EA shipped it with the assets outside the package; what circulates is
 *     the extracted tree, so there is no zip to open in the first place.
 *
 * So the driver is inverted with respect to the other two ports: *we* own the
 * frame loop and call into the engine, instead of feeding lifecycle commands
 * to an engine that owns its own.
 *
 * The call order below is not deduced from the symbol names - it is copied
 * from deadspace_main() in the Vita port (vita-ref/loader/main.c, MIT), which
 * runs this exact build. Two of its choices are worth naming because the
 * obvious alternative is wrong:
 *
 *   - the entry point is NativeOnCreate. The .so also exports runEntryPoint,
 *     which reads like the real one; the working port never calls it.
 *   - NativeOnSurfaceChanged is never called either. The renderer takes its
 *     resolution once, at surface-created time.

     * so once the crash reports became readable: the engine opens

     * audio, it leaves the engine holding a half-built object that it has no

     * a 1 MiB buffer, stereo, 44100 Hz. Two of its choices are not copied.

     * sentinels its fake JNI recognises by value. Ours resolves methods through
     * a class registry and calls _getClass() on the receiver, so a sentinel
     * would fault the moment the engine called anything on it. A real instance
     * of the AudioTrack fake class goes in instead, which is also what makes
     * SDL produce sound rather than merely not crash.
     *
     * `this` stays a sentinel: the method is static in Java and the engine
     * never dereferences it, so a made-up object would be less honest about
     * that than a value nobody can mistake for one.
