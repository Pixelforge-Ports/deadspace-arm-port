# Third-party code and licensing

This port is released under **GPL-3.0** (see `LICENSE`). It carries code from
several upstream projects; this file records where each part came from, because
the licences differ and the originals must keep their attribution.

The Dead Space PortMaster port, its project direction and the `eapx` extraction
tool were created by **EapRules**.

## Where the code comes from

| Part | Origin | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `loader/` — bionic ELF loader, relocations, symbol hooking | [gmloader-next](https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/gmloader-next) by JohnnyonFlame, itself derived from the Vita so-loader by **Andy Nguyen** | GPL (see note) |
| `thunks/libc/` — bionic→glibc thunks | gmloader-next | GPL |
| `thunks/libc/time64.cpp`, `thunk_time64.h` | `y2038` by **Michael G Schwern** | MIT / Artistic |
| `thunks/libc/fortify.cpp` | The Android Open Source Project (parts © Regents of the University of California) | Apache-2.0 / BSD |
| `jni/jni.h` | The Android Open Source Project | Apache-2.0 |
| `loader/leb128.h` | Free Software Foundation (binutils) | GPL |
| `thunks/khronos/` | glad generator, Khronos headers | MIT / Apache-2.0 |
| `third_party/powervr/PVRTDecompress.*` | [PowerVR SDK](https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK) by Imagination Technologies | MIT |
| `src/vfp_vector_patch.cpp` register decoding/scalar emission | adapted from VFPVector by **Bythos14** | MIT |
| accelerometer gesture samples in `android/input_bridge.cpp` | adapted from [deadspace-vita](https://github.com/v-atamanenko/deadspace-vita) by **v-atamanenko** | MIT |
| `tools/eapx.py` — transactional first-boot donor extractor | written by **EapRules** | GPL-3.0 |
| `android/`, `jni/classes/xt_*`, `src/`, `harness/`, `ports/` | written for this port | GPL-3.0 |

The ARM shared libraries under `libs.armhf/` are copied from Debian armhf
packages by `tools/collect_libs.sh`. The release includes the exact Debian
copyright file for every bundled SONAME under `licenses/libraries/`.

## Note on the GPL version

Upstream is not self-consistent, so this is worth stating plainly rather than
leaving for someone to trip over:

- The gmloader-next README says the project is released under **GPLv2**.
- But `loader/so_util.cpp` carries Andy Nguyen's original header, which says
  **GPLv3**, and the bundled licence text includes the customary *"either
  version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version"*.

GPL-3.0 is the version that satisfies both readings, so that is what this
repository uses. `loader/LICENSE-gmloader.md` is kept verbatim as it was
received. If JohnnyonFlame states that gmloader-next is GPLv2-**only**, this
repository will relicense to match — open an issue and it will be corrected.

## What is *not* in here

No game code, assets, or data from Dead Space are distributed by this project.
The supported binary is EA/IronMonkey's Xperia Play release; you supply your
own copy. The port loads it at runtime and circumvents no protection.

The 4:3 screenshot under `ports/deadspace/` was captured from the user's own
copy through this loader. The cover is a fan-made composition put together for
this port; it is not an EA product and was never issued by one. It carries
marks owned by others - Electronic Arts and Visceral Games among them - used
here only to identify the game the port loads. Both images exist solely so the
title is recognisable in the PortMaster menu and in the frontend's game list,
and neither is required for the port to run: delete them and it still works.
If a rights holder would rather they were not distributed, open an issue and
they come out.
